_Ensures request processing workflows comply with the defined requirements_

## Request State Machine Implementation

**ID**: RWA-001  
**Severity**: critical  

Request processing must implement the exact state machine defined in requirements

**Reference**: 24_Network_Communication_Requirements.md:Request_Flow:States

**Pattern Type**: semantic  
**Pattern Query**: class that processes requests but does not implement state transitions as defined in requirements  

**Message**: Request processing must follow the state machine defined in requirements. Implement all required states and transitions.

## Request Workflow Processing Order

**ID**: RWA-002  
**Severity**: critical  

Request processing steps must be executed in the exact order specified in requirements

**Reference**: 24_Network_Communication_Requirements.md:Request_Flow:Workflow

**Pattern Type**: semantic  
**Pattern Query**: method that processes requests in a different order than specified in requirements  

**Message**: Request processing must follow the exact order of steps defined in requirements.
