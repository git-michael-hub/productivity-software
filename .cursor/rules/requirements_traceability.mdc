# Requirements Traceability

_Rules to ensure code is aligned with formal requirements documentation_

## Requirement Reference

**ID**: requirement-reference  
**Severity**: error  

Code must include references to the requirements it implements

- Include requirement ID/reference in code comments using '@requirement' tag
- Link code to specific sections in requirements documents
- Document deviation from requirements with justification
- Update requirement references when code functionality changes
- Flag orphaned code that doesn't map to any requirement

## Requirements Verification

**ID**: requirements-verification  
**Severity**: error  

Tests must verify requirements are correctly implemented

- Tests should specifically reference requirements they verify
- Each functional requirement needs corresponding test(s)
- Test descriptions should reflect requirement language
- Use requirement-based test naming conventions
- Document requirements coverage in test documentation

## Requirements-Based Commits

**ID**: requirements-based-commits  
**Severity**: warning  

Commit messages should reference requirements

- Include requirement ID in commit message
- Use format: '[REQ-XXX] Commit message'
- Reference multiple requirements as needed: '[REQ-XXX][REQ-YYY]'
- Describe how the commit fulfills the requirement
- Link to requirement document when applicable

## Implementation Alignment

**ID**: implementation-alignment  
**Severity**: error  

Code implementation must align with requirement specifications

- Honor API contracts specified in requirements
- Maintain data models as defined in requirements
- Use specified algorithms and patterns
- Implement exact business logic as documented
- Follow architecture models from requirements

## Requirements Change Impact

**ID**: requirements-change-impact  
**Severity**: warning  

Track impact of requirement changes on code

- Document affected code when requirements change
- Update code comments with requirement version references
- Add '@requirement-update' tag for changed requirements
- Track version of requirements used for implementation
- Include change notes for requirement-driven updates
