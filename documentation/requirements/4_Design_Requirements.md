### Key Animations

- **Page Transitions**
  - Enter: Fade in with slight upward movement
  - Exit: Quick fade out
  - Keep transitions consistent across the application
  - Maintain context during navigation

- **State Changes**
  - Hover: Subtle scale or background change
  - Active: Quick feedback with color change
  - Loading: Non-blocking spinner or progress bar
  - Success/Error: Brief flash with appropriate color

- **Motion Choreography**
  - Staggered animations for related elements
  - Coordinated transitions for complex changes
  - Logical direction of movement (adding = in, removing = out)
  - Maintain spatial relationships during transformations
