# Quality Assurance & Testing Requirements

Quality Assurance requirements ensure the software **works as expected** under different conditions and maintains high standards of reliability and performance.

## Test Strategy & Plan

### Testing Approach

- **Shift-Left Testing**
  - Testing begins early in development cycle
  - Developers include unit tests with every feature
  - Test-driven development (TDD) for critical components
  - Continuous testing integrated into CI/CD pipeline

- **Risk-Based Testing**
  - Higher test coverage for critical features
  - Core functionality receives most thorough testing
  - Security-sensitive areas undergo penetration testing
  - Data integrity features receive special attention

- **Test Environments**
  - Development: For developer testing
  - Testing: Isolated environment for QA team
  - Staging: Production-like environment for final validation
  - Production: Limited A/B testing and monitoring

### Test Types

- **Functional Testing**
  - Feature testing against requirements
  - Regression testing for each release
  - Boundary value analysis
  - Negative testing for error handling

- **Non-Functional Testing**
  - Performance testing
  - Security testing
