# Security & Compliance Requirements

Security and compliance requirements ensure **data protection**, **user safety**, and **regulatory compliance** for the productivity software.

## Authentication & Authorization

### Access Control
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
  - Predefined roles: Admin, Manager, Editor, Viewer
  - Custom role creation for enterprise accounts
  - Fine-grained permission controls at project, folder, and document levels
